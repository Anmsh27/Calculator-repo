## Other things

To run, run executable. Windows will try to stop you from running it as it is from an unknown publisher but just click more options and then run anyways

It is safe and if you want to confirm, go through the source code

To run source code, you will need python and pygame installed. If pygame is not installed, install it with

```
pip install pygame
```

or it will automatically be installed by running main.py the first time

If that doesnt work, then here is a tutorial on [how to install pip](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/)

You probably wont need this because pip comes preinstalled with python

To run source code, double click and if the *run with what app* dialogue box opens up, select python

No need for python or any of the other dependencies if you are running the executable(.exe) file
